# Tree-Gift-Shop

*A webshop for buying tree gift cards. You buy, we plant. Why buy flowers if you can buy a tree? It's good for your marriage AND the environment!*

In a team of four people we worked out our first project in Full Stack Development. 
Together we developed a web app where the user can buy a tree as a gift.

## Summary of our main features:

* choosing a tree/ trees 
* saving the chosen trees in a cart 
* Login

* react
* react-bootstrap
* react-bootstrap-icons 
* mysql
* nodemailer
* stripe
* axios
* cors
* local-storage
* sass
* confetti
* express
