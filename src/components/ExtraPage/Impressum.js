                        <p>Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our webserver (computer on which this website is saved/stored) automatically saves data such as</p>
                        <ul class="adsimple-121612670">

                        <p>Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically. We do not pass this information to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p>
                        <h2 id="cookies-en" class="adsimple-121612670">Cookies</h2>
                        <p>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
                        For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what cookies are and why they are in use.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What exactly are cookies?</h3>
                        <p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
                        <p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>
                        <p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>
                        <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.</p>
                        <p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
                        <p>
                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">name:</strong> _ga<br />

                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br />
                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
                        <p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
                        <ul class="adsimple-121612670">
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">at least 50 cookies per domain</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">at least 3000 cookies in total</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
                        <p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
                        <p>
                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">Essential Cookies<br />
                        </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p>
                        <p>
                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">Purposive Cookies<br />
                        </strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.</p>
                        <p>
                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">Target-orientated Cookies<br />
                        </strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p>
                        <p>
                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">Advertising Cookies<br />
                        </strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>
                        <p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How can I delete cookies?</h3>
                        <p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p>
                        <p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p>

                        <p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How is my data protected?</h3>
                        <p>There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires the user’s consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p>
                        <p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.</p>

                        <h2 id="google-fonts-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121612670">Google Fonts Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).</p>
                        <p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
                        <p>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a list of over 800 fonts which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=121612670">Google</a> LLC provides its users for free.</p>
                        <p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
                        <p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Which data is saved by Google?</h3>
                        <p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google’s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for „Application Programming Interface“ and works as a software data intermediary.</p>
                        <p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts’ BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google’s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.</p>
                        <p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser’s screen resolution and name to Google’s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
                        <p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p>
                        <p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google’s aim is to fundamentally boost websites’ loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How can I delete my data or prevent it being stored?</h3>
                        <p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google’s support at <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=121612670">https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=121612670</a>. The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.</p>
                        <p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=121612670">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=121612670</a>. While Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention.<br />
                        It proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.</p>
                        <p>On <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&tid=121612670">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB</a> you can read more about what data is generally collected by Google and what this data is used for.</p>
                        <h2 id="facebook-pixel-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121612670">Facebook Pixel Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>We use Facebook’s Facebook pixel on our website. For that, we have implemented a code on our website. The Facebook pixel is a segment of a JavaScript code, which, in case you arrived on our website via Facebook ads, loads an array or functions that enable Facebook to track your user actions. For example, if you buy a product on our website, the Facebook pixel is triggered and then saves your actions on our website in one or more cookies. These cookies enable Facebook to match your user data (customer data such as IP address, user ID) with the data of your Facebook account. After that, Facebook deletes your data again. The collected data is anonymous as well as inaccessible and can only be used for ad placement purposes. If you are a Facebook user and you are logged in, your visit to our website is automatically assigned to your Facebook user account.</p>
                        <p>We exclusively want to show our products or services to persons, who are interested in them. With the aid of the Facebook pixel, our advertising measures can get better adjusted to your wishes and interests. Therefore, Facebook users get to see suitable advertisement (if they allowed personalised advertisement). Moreover, Facebook uses the collected data for analytical purposes and for its own advertisements.</p>
                        <p>In the following we will show you the cookies, which were set on a test page through the integration of the Facebook pixel. Please consider that these cookies are only examples. Depending on the interaction that is made on our website, different cookies are set.</p>

                        <h2 id="facebook-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121612670">Facebook Data Policy</h2>
                        <p>We use selected Facebook tools on our website. Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services. In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook and how you can delete these data.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What are Facebook tools?</h3>
                        <p>Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is Facebook’s official name for the tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them “Facebook tools”. They include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="adsimple-121612670">
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Facebook-Pixel</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">social plugins (e.g. the “Like” or “Share“ button)</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Facebook Login</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Account Kit</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">APIs (application programming interface)</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Plattform-integrations</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Plugins</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Codes</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Specifications</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Documentations</li>
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Technologies and Services</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside of Facebook.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3>
                        <p>We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people’s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.</p>
                        <p>Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website “event data” and uses them for analytics services. That way, Facebook can create “campaign reports” about our ad campaigns’ effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you can share our site’s contents directly on Facebook.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What data is saved by the Facebook tools?</h3>
                        <p>With the use of the Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.</p>
                        <p>Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member). However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called “Hashing” takes place. This means, that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of encrypting data.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, not only contact data, but also “event data“ is transferred. These data are the information we receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, “event data“ can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.</p>
                        <p>To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=121612670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How long and where are the data saved?</h3>
                        <p>Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products. Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
                        <p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.</p>
                        <p>The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook account works as follows:</p>
                        <p>1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.</p>
                        <p>2) Then, click “Your Facebook information“ in the left column.</p>
                        <p>3) Now click on “Deactivation and deletion”.</p>
                        <p>4) Choose “Permanently delete account“ and then click on “Continue to account deletion“.</p>
                        <p>5) Enter your password, click on “continue“ and then on “Delete account“.</p>
                        <p>The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among others. You can deactivate, clear or manage both all and individual cookies in your browser. How this can be done differs depending on the browser you use. The following instructions show, how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>

                        <h2 id="instagram-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121612670">Instagram Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>We have integrated functions of Instagram to our website. Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook’s products. The inclusion of Instagram’s contents on our website is called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function, data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.</p>
                        <p>In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook’s Data Policy.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What is Instagram?</h3>
                        <p>Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To “Insta“ (how the platform is casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Why do we use Instagram on our website?</h3>
                        <p>Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.</p>
                        <p>Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do not identify you personally.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What data is saved by Instagram?</h3>
                        <p>Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins) integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram’s servers. Thereby, data is sent to, as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.</p>
                        <p>Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram. Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only transmitted to Instagram, if they have been “hashed” first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned “event data“ (data on your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.</p>
                        <p>We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account on Instagram or have visited <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="http://www.instagram.com?tid=121612670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we have studied Instagram’s data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram collects and retains.</p>
                        <p>In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly more cookies.<br />
                        The following cookies were used in our test:</p>

                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How long and where are these data stored?</h3>
                        <p>Instagram shares the information obtained within the Facebook businesses with external partners and persons you are globally connected with. Data processing is done according to Facebook’s internal data policy. Your data is distributed to Facebook’s servers across the world, partially for security reasons. Most of these servers are in the USA.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
                        <p>Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data. Furthermore, you can manage your data in Instagram’s settings. If you want to delete your data on Instagram completely, you will have to delete your Instagram account permanently.</p>
                        <p>And this is how an Instagram account can be deleted:</p>
                        <p>First, open the Instagram app. Then, navigate to your profile page, select the three bars in the top right, choose “Settings” and then click “Help”. Now, you will be redirected to the company’s website, where you must click on “Managing Your Account” and then “Delete Your Account”.</p>
                        <p>When you delete your account completely, Instagram deletes posts such as your photos and status updates. Any information other people shared about you are not a part of your account and do therefore not get deleted.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned before, Instagram primarily stores your data via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, managing them varies a bit. We will show you the instructions of the most relevant browsers here.</p>

                        <h2 id="twitter-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121612670">Twitter Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>We have incorporated Twitter functions on our website. These are, for example, embedded tweets, timelines, buttons or hashtags. Twitter is a short message service and social media platform from the firm Twitter Inc., One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2 D02 AX07, Ireland.</p>
                        <p>To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, a mere integration of the Twitter function does not transfer any personal data or data about your web activities to Twitter. Only when you interact with the Twitter functions, such as by clicking a button, data could be sent to Twitter and get saved as well as processed there. We have no influence on this processing of data and do not bare any responsibility for it. Within this privacy statement, we want to give you an overview of what data Twitter stores, what Twitter does with this data and how you can largely protect yourself from data transmission.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What is Twitter?</h3>
                        <p>For some, Twitter is a news service, for others, a social media platform, and for others still it is a microblogging service. All these terms are justified and mean pretty much the same.</p>
                        <p>Both individuals as well as companies use Twitter for communicating with interested people via short messages. Twitter only allows 280 characters per message. These messages are called “tweets”. In contrast to Facebook, for example, the service does not focus on the expansion of a network of “friends”, but strives to be regarded as an open, worldwide news platform. On Twitter you can also have an anonymous account and tweets can be deleted by both, either the company or the users themselves.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Why do we use Twitter on our website?</h3>
                        <p>Like many other websites and companies, we try to use different channels for offering our services and communicating with our customers. Twitter is a truly useful “small” news service, which is why it has grown dear to us. We regularly tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We understand that you do not have the time to follow every channel after channel, as you surely have enough other things to do. That is why we also have integrated Twitter functions to our website. That way, you can experience our Twitter activities “on site” or come to our Twitter page via a direct link. With the integration, we want to strengthen the service and user-friendliness on our website.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What data is stored by Twitter?</h3>
                        <p>You will find integrated Twitter functions on some of our subpages. If you interact with Twitter content, such as by clicking a button, Twitter may collect and save data. This can happen even if you don’t have a Twitter account yourself. Twitter calls this data “log data”. It includes demographic data, browser cookie IDs, your smartphone’s ID, hashed email addresses, and information on which pages you have visited on Twitter and what actions you have taken there. Of course, Twitter stores more data if you have a Twitter account and are logged in. This retention is usually done via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are usually set in your browser and transmit various information to Twitter.</p>
                        <p>We will now show you which cookies are placed if you are not logged in to Twitter but visit a website with built-in Twitter functions. Please consider this list as an example. We do not claim for this list to be extensive, since the array of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with Twitter content.<br />

                        <strong class="adsimple-121612670">Note: </strong>Twitter also works with third parties. Therefore, we have recognized the three Google Analytics cookies _ga, _gat, _gid in our test.</p>
                        <p>On the one hand, Twitter uses the collected data for gaining better understand on user behaviour, and thus to improve their own services and advertising offers. On the other hand, the data are also used for internal security measures.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
                        <p>When Twitter collects data from other websites, after a maximum of 30 days, they will be deleted, summarized or otherwise concealed. Twitter’s servers are in various server centres in the United States. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the gathered data will be collected and stored in America. In our research we could not clearly determine whether Twitter also owns servers in Europe. Generally, Twitter may keep collected data stored until either the data are no longer useful to the company, until you delete the data or until a potential legal deletion period has been reached.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
                        <p>In their Privacy Policy, Twitter repeatedly emphasize that they do not save data from external website visits, provided you or your browser are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you interact directly with Twitter, the company will of course store your data.</p>
                        <p>If you have a Twitter account, you can manage your data by clicking on “More” under the “Profile” button. Then click on “Settings and privacy”. Here you can manage data processing individually.</p>

                        <p>On our website we use the Klarna Checkout online payment system by the Swedish company Klarna Bank AB. Klarna Bank is headquartered in Sveavägen 46, 111 34 Stockholm, Sweden. If you choose this service, your personal data will be sent to Klarna, where it will be stored and processed. With this privacy policy we want to give you an overview of Klarna’s data processing.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What is Klarna Checkout?</h3>
                        <p>Klarna Checkout is a payment system for online shops. The user selects the payment method and Klarna Checkout takes over the entire payment process. Once a user has made payment via the checkout system and provided the relevant data, future online purchases can be made even faster and easier. Klarna’s system then recognises the existing customer after they enter their email address and postcode.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Why do we use Klarna Checkout on our website?</h3>
                        <p>It is our goal to offer you the best possible service with our website and our integrated online shop. In addition to the overall website and offer experience this also includes smooth, fast and secure payment processing of your orders. To ensure this, we use the Klarna Checkout payment system.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What data is stored by Klarna Checkout?</h3>
                        <p>As soon as you choose Klarna’s payment service and pay using Klarna Checkout, you transmit personal data to the company. On Klarna’s checkout page, technical data such as browser type, operating system, our web address, date and time, your IP address as well as your language and time zone settings are collected and transmitted to Klarna’s servers where they are stored. This data is stored even if you have not yet completed an order at that point.</p>
                        <p>If you order a product or service from our shop, you must enter your personal data in the provided fields. Klarna processes this data for handling the payment. The following personal data (along with general product information) may be stored and processed by Klarna to check your creditworthiness and identity:</p>
                        <ul class="adsimple-121612670">
                        <li class="adsimple-121612670">Contact information: Name, date of birth, national ID number, title, invoice- und shipping address, email address, telephone number, nationality or salary.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Furthermore, there are data which may optionally be collected if you have specifically decided for it. These are for example political, religious, or ideological beliefs or various health data.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the data mentioned above, Klarna can also collect data about the goods or services you order. It may also do this via third parties (such as e.g. us or public databases). This can for example be the type or tracking number of the ordered article, but also information on your creditworthiness, as well as your income or loan grants. Klarna can also pass on your personal data to service companies such as software and data storage providers or us as a retailer.</p>

                        <p>On our website we offer the payment method “Sofortüberweisung” from Sofort GmbH for cashless payment. Sofort GmbH has been part of the Swedish company Klarna since 2014, but is based in Germany, Theresienhöhe 12, 80339 Munich.</p>
                        <p>If you choose this payment method, your personal data will also be transmitted to Sofort GmbH or Klarna, where it will be stored and processed. In this privacy policy we will give you an overview of Sofort GmbH’s data processing.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What is “Sofortüberweisung”?</h3>
                        <p>Sofortüberweisung is an online payment system that enables you to place an order via online banking. The payment is processed by Sofort GmbH, while we immediately receive information about your payment. Anyone who has an active online banking account with a PIN and TAN can use this method. Only a few banks do not yet support this payment option.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">Why do we use “Sofortüberweisung” on our website?</h3>
                        <p>It is our goal to offer you the best possible service with our website and our integrated online shop. Next to the overall experience of the website and offers, this also includes smooth, fast, and secure payment processing of your orders. To ensure this, we use “Sofortüberweisung” as a payment system.</p>
                        <h3 class="adsimple-121612670">What data is stored by “Sofortüberweisung”?</h3>
                        <p>If you make an immediate transfer via the Sofort/Klarna service, data such as your name, account number, sort code, payment reference, amount and date are stored on the company’s servers. We then also receive this information via the payment confirmation.</p>
                        <p>As part of the check for sufficient account coverage, Sofort GmbH reviews whether your account balance and overdraft can cover the payment amount. In some cases, it is also reviewed whether any instant transfers have been successfully carried out within the last 30 days. Furthermore, a shortened (“hashed”) form of your user identification (such as your signatory or contract number) as well as your IP address will be stored. For SEPA transfers your BIC and IBAN will also be stored.</p>
                        <p>According to Sofort GmbH, no other personal data (such as account balances, sales data, transaction limits, account lists, mobile phone numbers, authentication certificates, security codes or PIN/TAN) are collected, stored or passed on to third parties.</p>
                        <p>Sofortüberweisung also uses cookies to make our service more user-friendly. When you order a product, you will be redirected to the Sofort or Klarna website.

                        <p>If you want to know more about Sofort GMmbH’s data processing, we recommend the privacy policy at <a class="adsimple-121612670" href=" https://cdn.klarna.com/1.0/shared/content/legal/terms/0/en_gb/privacy?tid=121612670">https://cdn.klarna.com/1.0/shared/content/legal/terms/0/en_gb/privacy</a>.</p>

                        <p>In order to be able to deliver all the individual sub-pages of our website to you quickly and securely on all devices, we use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) BootstrapCDN of the American software company StackPath, LLC 2012 McKinney Ave. Suite 1100, Dallas, TX 75201, USA.</p>
                        <p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the Internet. Through this network, content – especially very large files, can be delivered quickly, even with large peak loads.</p>
                        <p>BootstrapCDN enables the delivery of JavaScript libraries to your browser. If your browser then downloads a file of the BootstrapCDN, your IP address is transmitted to the company StockPath during the connection with the Bootstrap CDN server.</p>
                        <p>In their privacy policy, StackPath also mention that the company uses aggregated and anonymised data from various services (such as BootstrapCDN). This is done to extend the backup, as well as for other StackPath services and clients. However, none of this data can be used to identify any person.</p>
                        <p>If you want to prevent this data transmission, you can install a JavaScript blocker (for example at <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://noscript.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://noscript.net/</a>), or deactivate the execution of JavaScript codes in your browser. However, please note that this means that the website then can no longer offer its usual services (such as fast loading speeds).</p>
                        <p>StackPath is an active participant in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data. More information on this can be found at <a class="adsimple-121612670" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CbahAAC&status=Active" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CbahAAC&status=Active</a>.<br />
