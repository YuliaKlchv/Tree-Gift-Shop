    "question": "What does 'gift in progress' mean?",
    "answer": "It means that you have correctly performed the gift delivery procedure, but the person you have sent the tree to has not yet redeemed it. As long as the person to whom you have given the tree as a gift has not redeemed it, the tree will continue to be yours and appear in the 'tree-yours' section of your profile. When the person redeems the tree, the tree will become theirs. You will still be able to find it on your profile in the 'Trees - Gifts' section of your profile.",
